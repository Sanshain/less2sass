/* unlike css, there are no functions in less to return a value. Instead,
values are assigned to variables,
which are then spat out together with the mixin call to the environment and these values can be used there. Thus,
to find out what the function should return,
you need to parse the entire syntax tree where this mixin is called. It is possible that several variables are used,
then a dictionary should be returned to sass. In general Too hard to implemened
